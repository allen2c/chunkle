This is a test for round-trip preservation.
It has multiple lines of content.
Some lines are short.
<CHUNKLE_TESTCASE_SEPARATOR/>Others are longer to test the token counting functionality properly.

The algorithm should preserve all characters exactly.
<CHUNKLE_TESTCASE_SEPARATOR/>No data should be lost during chunking.
Each chunk (except the last) must meet both line and token minimums.

<CHUNKLE_TESTCASE_SEPARATOR/>Final line to complete the test case.
