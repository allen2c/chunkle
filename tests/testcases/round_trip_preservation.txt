This is a test for round-trip preservation.
It has multiple lines of content.
Some lines are short.
Others are longer to test the token counting functionality properly.

The algorithm should preserve all characters exactly.
No data should be lost during chunking.
Each chunk (except the last) must meet both line and token minimums.

Final line to complete the test case.
